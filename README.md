# Vladimir Karashchuk

Developer and toolmaker. Co-authored research at Meta FAIR Labs (NeurIPS 2024).

I build things that solve real problems - pipeline tools that process thousands of assets, custom game engines from scratch, Blender addons that turn 15 manual steps into 2 clicks.

## What I'm doing now
Building a custom game engine in Odin with SDL3. Learning systems programming, graphics, low-level architecture.

## Background
- Shipped 20+ game jams - taught me to prototype fast and cut scope without cutting quality
- Built dataset infrastructure at Meta FAIR Labs for embodied AI research
- Pipeline tools, technical art, making the tedious automatic
